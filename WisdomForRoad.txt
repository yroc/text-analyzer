Wisdom For The Road 

Cherish things 
while you still have them, 
before they are gone, 
and you realize how 
precious they really are. 

Life can only be 
understood backwards, 
but it must be lived forwards. 

Everything in life is temporary. 
So if things are going good, 
enjoy it because 
it will not last forever. 

And if things are going bad, 
do not worry because it will not 
last forever either. 

Destiny is 
not a matter of chance, 
it is a matter of choice; 
it is not a thing to be waited for, 
it is a thing to be achieved. 

A journey of a thousand miles 
begins with a single step. 

Never cross a bridge 
without knowing how to swim the tides. 

If you could not 
add years to your life 

Add life to your years.
